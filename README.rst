XP skin for WisBar Advance
==========================

27th December 2003

Preamble
--------

I hope you enjoy it; no warranty. Feel free to redistribute so long as you include this readme unmodified.

This is a WisBar Advance skin. It's possible you could get it to work with ICBar or the like, but try first with WisBar Advance (it's free and it's good) from

* http://www.lakeridgesoftware.com/wisbar

This skin was adapted in no small part from Farnold's "More XP Blue" ICBar skin, which can be found at

* http://www.ictinus.com/icbar/icbarskins.html
 
The latest version of this skin, however, can always be found at

Bugs
----

There are a few minor tweaks needed to this skin and to WisBarAdvance

* WBA needs to tile the backgrounds so that the skin can further compressed and also so that the screen can be enlarged to greater resolutions (with DotPocket, for instance) without looking corrupted.
* If WBA supported a "background" colour and let part of the background and menubar graphics be transparent, users could recolour the skin without having to edit it.
* The skin doesn't have a memory meter integrated with its battery meter. I didn't want one and I doubt I'll put one in.
* The battery meter can behave oddly from time to time.
* WBA doesn't draw the start graphic correctly: there are occasionally some lighter coloured dots on it.
